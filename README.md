# Pokemon-Widgets
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow by extracting, cleaning, and visualizing rich structured data from online Pok√©mon databases. While the subject matter is gamified, the techniques and technologies reflect real-world data science and data engineering challenges, including web scraping, data wrangling, and interactive analytics.
The scope of this project is limited to Pokemon from generations 1-5 (games that were playable on the Nintendo DS lite).
There are 4 Jupyter notebooks that display different Pokemon data and some are dependent on one another. Specifically, every notebook runs  'National Pokedex.ipynb' to use the web scraping functionality defined within. 
'[Widgets.ipynb](https://github.com/thomasbase/Pokemon-Widgets/blob/main/Widgets.ipynb)' consolidates all other notebooks and is designed to serve as the final front-end user interface to query and display a variety of Pokemon data.
