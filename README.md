# Pokemon-Widgets
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow by extracting, cleaning, and visualizing rich structured data from online Pok√©mon databases. While the subject matter is gamified, the techniques and technologies reflect real-world data science and data engineering challenges, including web scraping, data wrangling, and interactive analytics.
The scope of this project is limited to Pokemon from generations 1-5 (games that were playable on the Nintendo DS lite).
